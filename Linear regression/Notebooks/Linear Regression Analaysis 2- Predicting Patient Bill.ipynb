    "# Problem Framing: Hospital Billing Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Predict the total **hospital billing amount** using only information available **at or before admission** to enable upfront cost estimates for patients and insurers.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Problem Type & Target\n",
    "- **Type**: Supervised Regression  \n",
    "- **Target Variable**: `Billing_Amount` (continuous, in local currency)\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Input Features (Admission-Time Only)\n",
    "To prevent data leakage, features are limited to those known at admission:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Demographics**: Age, Gender, Blood Type  \n",
    "- **Clinical**: Primary Medical Condition, Admission Medication, Initial Test Results  \n",
    "- **Administrative**: Admission Type, Doctor, Hospital, Insurance Provider, Room Type  \n",
    "- **Temporal**: Admission Date → engineered as day of week, season, etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> ❌ **Excluded**: Discharge Date and Length of Stay (would leak future information)\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Evaluation Strategy\n",
    "- **Metrics**: RMSE, MAE  \n",
    "- **Baselines**: \n",
    "  - Global mean billing\n",
    "  - Mean billing per medical condition  \n",
    "- **Validation**: Time-based split (e.g., train on 2022–2023, test on 2024) to simulate real-world deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Key Considerations\n",
    "- **No data leakage**: Only admission-time data is used.  \n",
    "- **Fairness**: Monitor for bias across insurance types, hospitals, or demographics.  \n",
    "- **Interpretability**: Model decisions should be explainable to stakeholders.  \n",
    "- **Clinical alignment**: Billing should reflect care intensity—not irrelevant patient attributes."
